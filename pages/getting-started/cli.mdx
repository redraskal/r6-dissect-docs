# Introduction to r6-dissect CLI

## CLI usage

Open Command Prompt or your desired terminal. If you placed r6-dissect in a different folder of choice, open the terminal in the containing folder.

On Windows, a trick for opening Command Prompt in the current File Explorer folder is typing "cmd" in the File Explorer address bar and hitting Enter (the current folder path in top middle of window).

## Match overview

To get started, you can print basic match information to the terminal. This is useful for identifying your matches outside of the game.

<Tabs items={["For a round", "For a match"]}>
	<Tab>
		```bash
		r6-dissect Match-2023-03-13_23-23-58-199/Match-2023-03-13_23-23-58-199-R01.rec
		```
	</Tab>
	<Tab>
		```bash
		r6-dissect Match-2023-03-13_23-23-58-199
		```
	</Tab>
	```
	5:20PM INF Version:          Y8S1/7422506
	5:20PM INF Recording Player: redraskal [1f63af29-7ebe-48e7-b570-e820632d9565]
	5:20PM INF Match ID:         d74d2685-193f-4fee-831f-41f8c7792250
	5:20PM INF Timestamp:        2023-03-13 13:00:08 -0500 CDT
	5:20PM INF Match Type:       QuickMatch
	5:20PM INF Game Mode:        Bomb
	5:20PM INF Map:              House
	```
</Tabs>

On Windows, you may need to escape the replay path with double quotes like so:

```batch
r6-dissect "C:\Users\Ben\Downloads\LIQ_MAG\LIQUID_MAGIC\Match-2023-03-25_14-24-02-118"
```

## Generating JSON data

You can save round stats to a JSON file like so:

<Tabs items={["For a round", "For a match"]}>
	<Tab>
		```bash
		r6-dissect Match-2023-03-13_23-23-58-199/Match-2023-03-13_23-23-58-199-R01.rec -x round_1.json
		```
	</Tab>
	<Tab>
		```bash
		r6-dissect Match-2023-03-13_23-23-58-199 -x match.json
		```
	</Tab>
</Tabs>

You can change the name of the JSON file.

### Example output for round_1.json:

```json

      "headshot": false,
      "time": "1:51",
      "timeInSeconds": 111
    },
...
```

## Generating an Excel spreadsheet

You can also generate an Excel spreadsheet for an entire match.

This spreadsheet will consist of one sheet containing player stats throughout the match as well as a sheet for each round.

```bash
r6-dissect Match-2023-03-13_23-23-58-199-R01 -x match.xlsx
```

As you can see, all you need change to generate Excel spreadsheets instead of JSON is to change the file extension from .json to .xlsx.

## Writing JSON to stdout

You can use the stdout export option to receive a JSON response in the terminal without any logging.

This is useful for bash scripts or for interfacing with r6-dissect in other programming languages.

For example, in TypeScript (using the [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime) you could write the following code to parse round data without creating a JSON file:

```ts
const data = Bun.spawnSync({
	cmd: ["r6-dissect", "-x", "stdout", "Match-2023-03-13_23-23-58-199/Match-2023-03-13_23-23-58-199-R01.rec"],
	stdout: "pipe",
}).stdout.toString();
const json = JSON.parse(data);
```

Although, in this case, we have an r6-dissect npm package for Bun that you can use.
