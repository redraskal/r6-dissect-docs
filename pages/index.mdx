# Introduction

</Callout>
 
Welcome to r6-dissect, a match replay API & CLI for [Rainbow Six Siege](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege)'s Dissect (.rec) format. Our goal is to understand the format & simplify data extraction.

The data format is subject to change until a stable version is released.

## Current Features

- Parsing match info (Game version, map, gamemode, teams, players & more...)
- Parsing Match Update events (Kills, defuser plants/disables, BattlEye bans, DCs & more...)
- Exporting stats to JSON, Excel, or stdout (in JSON)

## Roadmap

Our **Roadmap** can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/users/redraskal/projects/1). A few requested features are:
<br />
- [ ] Tracking player/gadget movement
- [ ] Tracking assists
- [ ] Tracking damage dealt
- [ ] Develop a UI alternative to the CLI & API
- [ ] Document Dissect file format

If your idea is not on the **Roadmap**, feel free to [Request a Feature](https://github.com/redraskal/r6-dissect/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=) on GitHub.
