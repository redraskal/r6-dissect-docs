| Filename                    |        Purpose         |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------: |
| r6-dissect(.exe)            |     CLI executable     |
| libr6dissect.h              |     C header file      |
| libr6dissect.(dll,so,dylib) | Shared library for FFI |
| LICENSE                     |    Our MIT license     |
| README.md                   | Overview of r6-dissect |

You can move the CLI executable to a couple of places. Here are our recommendations:

* Windows: `%userprofile%/r6-dissect.exe`
* Linux & macOS: `/usr/local/bin/r6-dissect`

On Windows, you can run the following command in Command Prompt to add %userprofile% to PATH:

```batch
setx PATH "%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%"
```

The command will ensure you can use r6-dissect in any location.

You could also place the CLI executable in the replay folder you will be working with.
